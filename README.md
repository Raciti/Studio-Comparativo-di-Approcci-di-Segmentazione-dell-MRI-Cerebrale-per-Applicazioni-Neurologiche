# Studio Comparativo di Approcci di Segmentazione dell'MRI Cerebrale per Applicazioni Neurologiche

The constant development of medical imaging technologies has revolutionized the diagnosis and monitoring of medical conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as one of the most crucial techniques, providing anatomical and functional details of extraordinary precision. However, accurate interpretation of these images requires considerable effort from specialists such as neurologists and radiologists. The advent of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, has opened new perspectives in the analysis of medical images. This thesis fits into this context, aiming to explore and evaluate the efficacy of traditional segmentation techniques and deep learning approaches specifically developed for segmenting anatomical structures in MRI images. A detailed analysis of these different methodologies, considering quantitative and qualitative metrics along with processing times, provides a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of each architecture, identifying their respective advantages and limitations. This research represents a step forward in the development of medical analysis tools based on image processing. The goal is not only to improve the accuracy and efficiency of MRI-based diagnoses but also to make these methodologies more accessible and reliable for a wide range of healthcare practitioners. A thorough understanding of the performance of different architectures in MRI image analysis significantly contributes to the evolution of the entire field of medical image processing. These advancements present an opportunity to refine and enhance diagnostic practices, paving the way for more sophisticated and precise methodologies in delivering and interpreting fundamental information for medical practice.
